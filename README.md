As a decentralized enterprise-level wallet, ChainUp Custody does not store customers' private keys. If you want to recover the private keys for your created MPC wallet, you can download and use ChainUp Custody's offline private key recovery tool. By using this tool in an offline environment, you can recover the complete private keys for all MPC wallets. Once the private key recovery is successful, you can import them into other hardware or software wallets, giving you full control over your digital assets.
